        If `chip_size` doesn't divide the height of the tile evenly (which is what is likely to happen) then we will sample an additional row of chips that are aligned to the bottom of the file.
        We do a similar operation if `chip_size` doesn't divide the width of the tile evenly -- by appending an additional column.

        Note: without a `transform` we will return chips in (height, width, channels) format in whatever the tile's dtype is.

        Args:
            fn: The path to the file to sample from (this can be anything that rasterio.open(...) knows how to read).
            chip_size: The size of chips to return (chips will be squares).
            stride: How much we move the sliding window to sample the next chip. If this is is less than `chip_size` then we will get overlapping windows, if it is > `chip_size` then some parts of the tile will not be sampled.
            channels: Input channels to return. Default is 3.
            transform: A torchvision Transform to apply on each chip.
            windowed_sample: If `True` we will use rasterio.windows.Window to sample chips without every loading the entire file into memory, else, we will load the entire tile up-front and index into it to sample chips.
            verbose: Flag to control printing stuff.
